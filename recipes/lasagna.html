        <h1>Grandma's Hamburger Casserole</h1>

        <img src="../img/w.webp">

        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>My grandmother's hamburger casserole is classic comfort food! Featuring ground beef, noodles, and a creamy cheese sauce, this simple recipe dates back to the 1940's.</p>
        <p>You can tweak the amount of cheese and sour cream depending on what you've got in the fridge — it'll still turn out great!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1 ground beef</li>

            <li>2 tomato sauce</li>

            <li>1 white sugar, or to taste</li>

            <li>1 garlic salt, or to taste</li>

            <li>1 salt, or to taste</li>

            <li>1 egg noodles</li>

            <li>1 sour cream</li>

            <li>3 cream cheese, softened</li>

            <li>1 كبيرة ، مقطعة إلى مكعبات صغيرة white onion, finely diced</li>
            
            <li>½ shredded sharp Cheddar cheese, or more to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.</li>
            <li>Mix tomato sauce, sugar, garlic salt, and salt into the ground beef; simmer until flavors blend, about 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and cover the skillet.</li>
            <li>While the sauce is cooking, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 7 to 9 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>While the egg noodles are cooking, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch casserole dish.</li>
            <li>Mix sour cream, cream cheese, and onion together in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Layer 1/2 of the egg noodles into the prepared casserole dish. Top with 1/2 of the sour cream mixture, then 1/2 of the ground beef mixture. Repeat layers once more. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese over top.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
